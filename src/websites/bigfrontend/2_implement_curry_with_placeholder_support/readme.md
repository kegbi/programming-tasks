This is a follow-up on 1. implement curry()

please implement curry() which also supports placeholder.

Here is an example

```js
const  join = (a, b, c) => {
return `${a}_${b}_${c}`
}

const curriedJoin = curry(join)
const _ = curry.placeholder

curriedJoin(1, 2, 3) // '1_2_3'

curriedJoin(_, 2)(1, 3) // '1_2_3'

curriedJoin(_, _, _)(1)(_, 3)(2) // '1_2_3'
```
